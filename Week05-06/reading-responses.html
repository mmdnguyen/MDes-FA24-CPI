                    <h4>Visual perceptions of color</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Quote(s)</strong></p>
                    <p>"The color picker is as omnipresent as it is broken: With no significant changes over the last decade, it fails to provide a meaningful visual representation of the color spectrum, even though such models have existed for more than 300 years. Instead, it uses a rectangular area to show a single hue at a time, and designers are left with no way to visualize the relationship between the selected colors, or even understand the difference between a perceptually uniform color model and its counterpart."</p>

                    <p>“In visual perception a color is almost never seen as it really is - as it physically is. This fact makes color the most relative medium in art.”<br>
                        Josef Albers (1963), <em>Interaction of Color</em></p>

                    <p>"These three triadic colors schemes have the same hue values, and look identical when plotted on the color circle. The term 'triadic' does not help to describe their distinct visual effects."</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
                    <p>I thought that this was an interesting observation that I didn't make the connection to initially, but upon reading this quote, really resonated with. The color picker in many Adobe applications fails to accurately represent colors, even just from the color dialogue box to the actual design. This might be due to the fact that the color in the dialogue box is being represented in an RGB color space when I happen to be designing in CMYK but in any instance, color inaccuracies are present within the same application, and even moreso across several platforms or from the human eye to print/digital.</p>

                    <h4>Subjectivity of color</h4>

                    <p><strong>Quote(s)</strong></p>
                    <p>"A good analogy to consider when working with saturations of color is the way many countries have distinct ways of painting houses in their cities. The saturations of these paints can vary greatly, and although these colors do not have any inherent meaning, they do say something about the time, place, and people. Imagine a small village in Japan with its muted, desaturated colors, and compare this to a place like Mexico, where houses are painted in very pure, saturated colors. These colors reflect the culture around them, and you should consider your content in the same way: Does it demand lively colors or a subdued, modernist scheme? The saturation of your colors is the key to this."</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
                    <p>I appreciate that this book touches on the impact and perception of color and how it might inform you about cultures. The book mentions earlier on about the color red being suitable for stop signs since it signifies danger or alert but red is also a prevalent color in Asian countries to signify good luck. It definitely makes me wonder if the color of stop signage changes due to this fact in Asian countries or if the color red is universally accepted as a symbol for danger.</p>

                    <h4>There is no true original design</h4>

                    <p><strong>Quote(s)</strong></p>
                    <p>"Digital design products must adapt to different screen sizes and show dynamic content, so there is no true original design. This forces designers to think systematically about visual layout."</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
                    <p>I'm interested in the concept that there is no true "original design" present when it comes to designing digital products and I can't tell if I agree or not. Between different screen sizes, the design is still recognizable as "that" design; it's not like more design aspects such as the font, color scheme, etc. is changing as the screen responsively sizes. However, I don't think this statement is untrue. I think it's more accurate to say that an original design exists but in a state of change/fluidity in that it maintains the overall look and feel but the structure is always changing in order to present information in a way that makes the most sense for the device and to the user.</p>

            <h2>What Do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>

                    <h4>The level of fidelity does not equal completion</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Quote(s)</strong></p>
                    <p>"Tools can be used in many different ways, and detail is not a sure indicator of completeness."</p>

                    <p>"It is important to recognize that the degree of visual and behavioral refinement of a prototype does not necessarily correspond to the solidity of the design or to a particular stage in the process."</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
                    <p>This was another topic that I hadn't initially realized until I actually read it. I am definitely guilty of creating a "high-fidelity" prototype that is visually detailed but lacked the appropriate functionalities to accurately portray the prototype, much less implement the final solution. I often find myself nailing down the aesthetic part of the prototype before fulling building out functionalities and therefore, the overall look and feel comes fairly early in my design process. These quotes made me realize that there is always work and iteration to be done.</p>

                    <p><strong>Quote(s)</strong></p>
                    <p>"Even the term 'prototype' is likely to be ambiguous on such a team. Everyone has a different expectation of what a prototype is. Industrial designers call a molded foam model a prototype. Interaction designers refer to a simulation of on-screen appearance and behavior as a prototype. Programmers call a test program a prototype. A user studies expert may call a storyboard, which shows a scenario of something being used, a prototype."</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
                    <p>I definitely interpret all of these examples as some form of prototype that I've worked with and created. However, this did make me realize that I do lean towards certain categories of prototypes as design solutions. This quote really highlights the necessity of cross-collaborating teams and departments to not only be able to create multiple design solutions, but also unify the goals and visions across all people working on the project.</p>

                    <h4>Categorization of prototypes</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Quote(s)</strong></p>
                    <p>"Prototypes provide the means for examining design problems and evaluating solutions. Selecting the focus of a prototype is the art of identifying the most important open design questions. If the artifact is to provide new functionality for users—and thus play a new role in their lives—the most important questions may concern exactly what that role should be and what features are needed to support it. If the role is well understood, but the goal of the artifact is to present its functionality in a novel way, then prototyping must focus on how the artifact will look and feel. If the artifact’s functionality is to be based on a new technique, questions of how to implement the design may be the focus of prototyping efforts."</p>

                    <p>"It is common practice to build prototypes in order to represent different states of an evolving design and to explore options. However, since interactive systems are complex, it may be difficult or impossible to create prototypes of a whole design in the formative stages of a project."</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong></p>
                    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this breakdown of different categories of prototypes and their applications in their respective scenarios. I think it definitely helps break down the problem during the initial design stage as well, in that by establishing one main goal (role, look & feel, and implementation), you have set yourself up for a good starting point. I feel that this method is also conducive to more effective iterations where you're able to work through each stage in order to create an integrated prototype of the whole design.</p>
