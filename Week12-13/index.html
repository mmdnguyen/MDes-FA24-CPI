            <h1>Finding & Refining Your Interface</h1>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>The interface I wanted to create was a simple figure drawing model that would plot out the general skeleton of a body based on webcam video. The interface would allow you to capture an image by pinching your index finger and thumb together of a pose you made in order to show you a skeleton to use as reference to use for figure drawing sketches. The completed interface would also have UI that allowed you to toggle a grid on and off in order to help with the drawing process.

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>This one was honestly really tough to wrap my head around! I spent a lot of time looking at documentation and existing models built in ml5.js in order to get an idea of what I wanted to do. I think I could have definitely spent more time reviewing documentation and exploring the capabilities of ml5.js.</p></li>
                <li><p>This took a lot of trial and error. I had to experiment a lot with the models to find out what their capabilities were.</p></li>
                <li><p>This was definitely the project that made the most sense to add UI to, and therefore was the project I added the most UI to in order to control different aspects of my interface. Since this was an interface built specifically for artists, some degree of customization was important, which therefore made user input through the UI I added very important as well.</p></li>
