            <h1>Low-Poly Modeling in Blender</h1>
            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>My concept was to create a tea time tablescape. My three objects are the table, chair, and tea set. I also wanted to try creating many smaller objects that I could duplicate in order to create a complete scene while still allowing me to play around with Blender's basic tools. This allowed me to spend more time familiarizing myself with Blender and experiment with what I could do with low-poly modeling.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>I think it was definitely a slow start in getting used to the new software. It was really beneficial for me to create so many objects just to get a good grasp of the tools and associated shortcuts.</p></li>
                <li><p>Utilizing different resources and tutorials was very important when it came to accomplishing what I was envisioning. It was helpful to see other people's approach to both utilizing the software and modeling certain objects.</p></li>
                <li><p>Something that really helped me along the way was using images as references for whatever object I was trying to model. It was difficult to envision what something was supposed to look like based on my memory alone and I think trying to mimic certain shapes was really useful when it came to understanding an object's anatomy and how it translates to modeling in Blender.</p></li>
